For project 6, we plan to make things towards creating
a multiplayer Tanks game, with bombs and things that can impact the environment.


As such, we'd need:
    - robust animations
        - perhaps view blur
    - robust collisions
    - robust physics system
    - particle system for impacts
    - lighting system for potentially a 'night' mode
    - potential ambient occlusion for tanks
    - potential normal mapping for tanks

We also would want:
    - a cool water rendering system
        - perhaps physics for impacts as well
    - day/night cycles
        - with correct tinting, potentially rotation or movement of sky cube.




NOTES FOR CURRENT MAP:
we impleemnted delta timing, so when the movement speed is slow, 
it's because hte map is very large, so distances seems smaller.
